# Falaubs

## Project Overview
Falaubs is a web application built using Django that provides a variety of functionalities, including user authentication, scheduling, vaccination management, and more. It serves as a platform to facilitate various administrative tasks efficiently, offering a user-friendly interface and a robust backend architecture.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Django** (if not already installed):
